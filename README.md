<h2>Road_Dataset-Time_Series_Prediction</h2>
This repository helps in performing time series prediction on Road Dataset of nearly 25Kms.

<h2>Dataset-</h2>
The dataset contains data collected from 13 sensors over 10 years for different patches of the road
Objective-
Make predictions of Parameter 9-13 from the given dataset for every Section of the tenth year and also find the RMSE of the model.

<h2>Methodology Used-</h2>
Using the 10th year data and predicting the output for 9-13 sensors for the 10 th year. Used Extra Regressor Model and implemented random forestto 
predicted the values.
